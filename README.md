# -fictional-octo-couscous

A simple torrent streamer.
I created this project because I was fascinated how apps like kodi and Elementum do this. 

This is a very simple streamer, I didn't have to scrape any data because there are already Python APIs that do this for you. This project took a couple of hours to create.
