<h1>A simple torrent streamer.</h1>
<h4>I created this project because I was fascinated how apps like kodi and Elementum do this. </h4>

<p>This is a very simple streamer, I didn't have to scrape any data because there are already Python APIs that do this for you. This project took a couple of hours to create.</p>

This project isn't complete. This program will eventually be fixed to run on Windows, and other distributions of Linux. 
It needs some fixing which I will get to once I've finished some other projects.
