<h1>A simple torrent streamer.</h1>
<h4>I created this project because I was fascinated how apps like kodi and Elementum do this. d</h4>

<p>This is a very simple streamer, I didn't have to scrape any data because there are already Python APIs that do this for you. This project took a couple of hours to create.</p>
